The application name is Box-Office.

a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.

The application consists of 4 pages. The first page is trending list of movies/series. The second page is Movies list. The third is Series list. The final page is search page.
Each page is styled using CSSstylesheet. The application is run using ReactJS server.

b. List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and that exemplify your proficiency. 

I have done the page scrolling well in all four pages. The description of the movies/series is done using Carousel.

Please describe why you chose those elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.

I have chosen scrolling cause the header and the footer bar stays throughout the navigation. Its fixed and this eases the users to quickly navigate. Also, carousel is used for easy viewing of movie details and it is very user friendly.  

c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task.  Describe why you would do those things. 

I would have improved the Search API more. Users prefer faster and more relevant search results.
